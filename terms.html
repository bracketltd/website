    <h3>1. Terms</h3>

    <h3>2. Use License</h3>
    <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download our apps for personal, non-commercial use only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
      <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in our apps</li>
      <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations</li>
      <li>Transfer the materials to another person or mirror the materials on any other server</li>

    <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Bracket Ltd. at any time.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The materials within our apps are provided on an 'as is' basis. Bracket Ltd. makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
    <p>In no event shall Bracket Ltd. or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use our apps. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

    <h3>6. Links</h3>
    <p>Bracket Ltd. has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its apps and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Bracket Ltd. of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Modifications</h3>
    <p>Bracket Ltd. may revise these terms of service at any time without notice. By using our apps, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>
