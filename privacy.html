    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Bracket Ltd. collects, uses, and protects information when you use our apps. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.</p>
    
    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
    <p>We collect minimal data about your use of our apps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymous usage statistics to help us improve our apps</li>
      <li>Device information (model, operating system version) to optimize app performance</li>
      <li>Crash reports to fix technical issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information unless explicitly needed for a specific function (such as account creation if applicable).</p>
    
    <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>If you make in-app purchases, payment information is processed by the App Store, not by us. We may receive confirmation that a purchase was completed, but we do not have access to your payment details or billing information.</p>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Our apps may use third-party services for analytics or payment processing. These services may collect anonymous usage data subject to their own privacy policies. We choose partners that follow industry best practices for data security.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>Most content you create in our apps is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this content unless you explicitly choose to share it with us (for example, when sending support requests).</p>

    <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
    
    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
